This folder is used to store blog entries data.
Within this folder there should be a sequence of folders labels by timestamps, one for each blog entry.
Within each of these folders there are two kinds of files: blog.txt containing a blog entry, and files of the form [timestamp].txt where [timestamp] is a timestamp.
